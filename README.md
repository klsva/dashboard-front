## Short description
Front-end part for KPI dashboard. The dashboard consists of three parts. 
In the first part, you can manage the current data - team, customers, invoices. 
In the second part, you can add new data (client) or change your calendar. 
In the third part, you can see data visualization on charts.
I used mock data.
